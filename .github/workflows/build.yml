#
# CI/CD Design strategy
#
# - Use GitHub Flow - that is:
#   - main is the only long lived branch
#   - work on feature branches
#   - merge to main when production ready
# - A merge/push to main triggers CI/CD workflow
# - Only tests.yml is triggered on push to main
# - All other workflows are triggerd by 'workflow_dispatch'
# - Workflows are daisy chained by dispatching the next workflow in line
# - The final workflow should deploy to stg.trackaler.com
# - A separate workflow that is not part of the daisy chain, should be
#   triggerable to deploy to production (or possibly a distinct set of parameters
#   for the deploy workflow)
#
# The flow should be:
# - push to main triggers test.yml
# - on success, test.yml should workflow_dispatch build.yml
# - on success, build.yml should workflow_dispatch deploy-stg.yml
#
# Once manual inspection and testing have occurred
# - manually workflow_dispatch deploy-prod.yml
#
# Issues, Questions...
# - can deploy-prod.yml use artifacts built during build.yml? Or do we need to rebuild?
