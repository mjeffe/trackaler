Simple site to track stuff over time

I created this site for a few reasons. It started because I knew someone who
was trying to lose weight. They were frustrated that all of the "free" sites
they could find to help track weight loss, were so commercial. They pester you
with upsells, harvested your data, have constant anoying adds, and in spite of
that, often charged a monthly fee. When I saw what was being offered, I thought
"this is fairly simple, and it should be free". But then I realized, you can
really track anything you like. So, for now, it's not weight-loss centric, it's
just a generic interface for tracking whatever you like.

Creating the site, also offered me the opportunity to work on some new
technologies that I needed experience with.

I don't know how much farther I'll take this project. I suppose it depends on
how much it gets used.

Either way, feel free to fork this code. I've released it under the [MIT
License](https://github.com/mjeffe/trackaler/LICENSE) so you are free to use it
however you wish. Credit is always nice if you find it useful.
